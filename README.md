# photon_index_binning

Another kinda useless readme:

This script contrasts photon index and luminosity for various observations. In order to reduce error, the data is binned together.  

Usage:
combine_bin.py - Assuming the necessary libraries are installed, this script
		 will bin and plot photon index vs luminosity for any # of 
		 galaxies. More info in script.
compare_bin.py - More for reference, this script allowed the user to compare 
		 the 13 original galaxies avaliable at the time of development
